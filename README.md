## 📄 Description
The **Short Form Generator** is a Python script designed to generate an acronym (short form) from a user-provided sentence. By taking a sentence as input, the program extracts the first letter of each word, transforms it to uppercase, and concatenates the letters to form the acronym.

This program is especially useful for generating short forms for organizations, projects, or concepts.

## 🌟 Features
✅ Accepts a user-inputted sentence.  
✅ Splits the sentence into individual words.
